A Chrome Extension, which can pop up an online python interpreter and automatically paste the selected code.

The python interpreter is [datacamp-light](https://github.com/datacamp/datacamp-light), which use a code label to wrap the python code. So you can get the element and modify its "innerText" attribute.
